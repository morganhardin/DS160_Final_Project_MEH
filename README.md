Abstract for DS 160 Final Project:

The dataset chosen for the analysis is an HR dataset and it consists of data the shows if an employee left a company 
along with 9 other variables that could have led to their departure. The dataset also contains information on the 
employeeâ€™s satisfaction, last evaluation, number of projects worked on, average monthly hours, time spent at the 
company, work accidents, promotions in the last five years, department, and salary. The dataset was chosen because 
it contained a mix of numerical and categorical variables with no missing values. The goal is to see what variables 
have a positive correlation with an employee leaving and training a machine learning logistic regression model to 
predict if they will leave a company based on the 9 variables. With this model, a company can predict if an 
employee will leave based on these variables before the employee actually leaves.
